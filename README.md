# Hi there! I'm Nick. 👋

### Excel geek and linguist turned programmer
With a background in project monitoring & evaluation and freelance technical translation, I entered the field of frontend web development with a great deal of experience with structured thinking, problem-solving and, well, Googling stuff.

I started to play around with programming in 2020 and finally took the decision to pursue a career in the field in 2022 by joining the Technigo Frontend Developer Bootcamp, which I'm currently working my way through.

I spend most of my limited free time these days with my partner, golden retriever and baby girl, but I also like to unwind with PC and board games whenever I get the chance.
